## In Progress

<!-- Exactly one (WIP=1). If two are listed, the harness is violated. -->

_None — all planned work for this session completed._

## Blocked

_None._

## Known Issues

- **No `.env.local`** on a fresh clone until `make setup` is run (expected — documented in .env.example).
- **`dist/` is checked in** — gh-pages workflow artifact. Not source — ignore in code review.
- **26 uncommitted dist/* changes** — pending `make deploy` after harness is confirmed green.

## Next Steps

1. **SP-04** (remainder) — Add `whileInView` to remaining unanimated sections: `ResponsibilitySection`, `MythOrFact`, `WhatMakesDifferent` heading.
2. **D04** (remainder) — Audit `MythOrFact.jsx` raw hex (`border-[#ff0000]`, rgba red) — replace with a `--danger` token or `text-destructive`.
3. **SP-05** — Catalog filter active-tab highlight at 375px (currently hard to see on mobile).
4. **SP-06** — Checkout progress indicator: step labels truncate on 375px.
5. `make deploy` — push current state to GitHub Pages after next check passes.

## Handoff Note

`make check` passes all 3 layers (L1 lint+arch, L2 vitest, L3 Playwright 3/3).
This session shipped: category tabs on single row (lg:flex-nowrap), SP-02 card hover (whileHover y:-4 + shadow-elevated 200ms),
SP-03 page transitions (AnimatePresence mode=wait via RouterApp inner component), Testimonials colour tokens fixed (text-gold, text-muted-foreground, shadow-elevated),
Footer inline styles removed + copyright 2026 + py-16 breathing room, FreeServices scroll-reveal (whileInView fadeUp), text-gradient-coral token added to index.css.
Next priority: finish SP-04 scroll-reveal on remaining sections + fix MythOrFact raw hex colours (D04).
